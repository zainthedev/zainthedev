## How to work with Zain Hill

### My work hours:
In general, I prefer not to work too early - 8am is too early, 9am is fine - or at night, past 6pm or so.

You can reach me however you want during work hours, although once work has finished, I tend to be unavailable in an attempt to fully relax and feel refreshed for the next day.

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
In most cases, a message through Slack is fine. 
However, I do enjoy direct conversation, and if it's something that would be easier to communicate directly, I prefer voice chat or face-to-face conversation.

If it's important, an email always works and stands out more than a Slack message.

If it's an emergency or is urgent, please call me! 

If I don’t respond, try: A follow-up message or email, a ping on Slack, or a call.

### I'd love to help you with ____
React bugs and troubles, design, and broken CSS.

I began experimenting with and teaching myself Adobe Photoshop when I was 12 years old, so I have some knowledge and skills there, too!

### What makes me grumpy?
Being hungry.

In all seriousness, I don't get grumpy very easily, and many people have told me I'm "zen".

If I had to pick one work-related thing, the first thing that comes to mind is a past colleague who was disrespectful to our boss, who definitely didn't deserve it.

In general, then, I think people who are disrespectful or rude to others make me grumpy.

### How do I like to give feedback?
For a general feedback, I like to use voice chat or face-to-face conversation.
For more detailed feedback, I find text works better, especially instant messages.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
Same as above.

I LOVE receiving feedback and feel that it's critical to success - not just in software engineering, but in any field.

I make electronic music, and often send my songs to one of my brutally honest friends who tells me what sounds good and what doesn't.

I appreciate the same thing with code.

### One of my goals for the coming year:
I'd love to learn more about the backend! 

Although frontend development is fun, I've noticed that the coolest and most impactful projects require backend skills.

I think that being able to combine the two would give me a lot of power and allow me to create anything that I want.

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about:

Work-related:
New technologies, best practices and pro-tips. 

Other:
Music, video games, film, a bit of anime, and the Japanese language.

### Other things you might want to know:

* Spouses/partners/kiddos/pets:
I have an awesome girlfriend of 3+ years, who I owe most of my Japanese skills to.
* My birthday: 
20/11/1995
* My hometown:
Cape Town, South Africa. Ask me about it!
